# Swift Pythagorastree
A former homework in informatics: built a Pythagoras Tree with a recursiv function. 
This is a tree for Swift Playgrounds. I'am no official Apple Developer, so you can not download the project from a Apple-Domain, so you have to copy this Code in a pre-built Playground "Forms" (Code in ``Tree.playgorund/contents.swift``). Alternatively you can download the Zip-file and open it with the 'Documents-App'. Or you can try to download the Playgroundbook‚Ä¶

Thanks to [Johann Galle](https://github.com/johann150) for supporting me deeply üòè

You can download Swift Playgrounds (for iPads only) [here](https://itunes.apple.com/de/app/swift-playgrounds/id908519492?mt=8) for free.

## Note
The code is commented in german. If you have any qeustions, how the code works, open a new Issue‚Ä¶
